            <p>These recipes, courtesy of <i>Sarah D.</i> are for Elvis Presley's favorite cake and an appropriate
                frosting. Sarah got the cake recipe from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_and_Michael_Stern"
                    target="_blank">Jane and Michael Stern</a> (no relation) in the <i>Boston Globe</i>. The cake was
                made for <i>Elvis</i> every year by a Mississippi hill-country woman. The woman, who
                wishes to remain anonymous, has used this recipe for over 50 years. It was her mother's and
                grandmother's before that. She still makes it and brings it to the <a
                    href="https://elvispresleybirthplace.com/" target="_blank">Elvis Presley Birthplace</a> (306 Elvis
                Presley Drive, Tupelo, Mississippi, for interested
                travelers) on his birthday.

                <q>We now know," Sarah adds, "that if drugs didn't kill Elvis, he would have soon been called home
                    with
                    arteries that couldn't pass water."

                <h2>Directions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Butter and flour a 10" tube pan<sup id="fn1-src"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>
                    <li>Thoroughly cream together the sugar and butter.</li>
                    <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in half the flour, the
                        whipping
                        cream, and then the rest of the flour, Add the vanilla.</li>
                    <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Set in a cold oven and bake at 350&deg;F. Bake until a
                        sharp knife inserted in the cake comes out clean,
                        about 60&ndash;70 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Let the cake cool for 5 minutes, and remove it from the pan, and then let cool thoroughly.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Notes &amp; Variations</h2>
                <p>Sarah says that if the cake is wrapped well, it will keep for several days. Also, she used country
                    Morning blend instead of butter (60% corn oil, 40% butter), only 5 eggs, and added more cream.</p>

                <p>Here's Sarah's mother's chocolate whipped cream frosting ("great ona cake that's already quite
                    sweet," she says):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup cocoa</li>
                    <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                    <li>1 tsp tbsp vanilla</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Mix together the sugar and cocoa. Add the cream. Chill for about 1 hour, then add vanilla, and whip
                    it. ("You can also add dissolved instant coffee to make a wonderful mocha frosting.")</p>

        <h2>Envoi</h2>
        <p>Great minds think alike. Shortly after I sent this recipe out, the estimable Bill O. gave me a
            copy of the Sterns' column in the Globe with the pound cake recipe. The column was accompanied
            by a cartoon showing Elvis crooning, "You ain't nothing but a pound cake." Maybe they are
            relatives of mine. The Sterns even recommend serving it with ice cream after a dinner of
            barbecue. What nice people. </p>
